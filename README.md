 ###**SkinWiseMR** 
 With the skyrocketing prices of cosmetics and beauty products and their adverse side effects, people tend to go for natural home beauty treatments. Women must be more aware of their skin type and have struggled with selecting appropriate products for their skin type. Some beauty products contain harmful chemicals that can damage the skin. Even though some beauty products may not produce the desired results for their users, this may lead to consumers being disappointed as well as stressed. Women may have a variety of facial issues, including acne, black spots, dark circles, radiant skin, and dry skin. It can be more difficult to choose the best natural remedy for these issues while considering the skin conditions after viewing a YouTube video or conducting online research. Although there will be numerous outcomes in YouTube comments, they might be either favorable or negative. By watching these videos, it's really confusing to select the best treatment, as well as time-consuming. The author discovered, via extensive research conducted in the beauty sector, that the advancement of home remedies is greatly undervalued. Numerous home remedy recommendation systems are carried out throughout the health and agricultural domains, but in the beauty domain it's a misplaced section with a very helpful area for consumers who are already trying out home remedies.This research project aims to design, implement & evaluate a novel recommendation architecture for natural home beauty remedies and their procedures with ingredients based on the user preferences such as skin conditions and remedy types.
