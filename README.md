## Projects i worked 
 ### CONVO 
In today’s globalized world English has been used for communication, business, education, and opportunity in general. Therefore, it is important to learn English as a second language. Many learners state that they have spent so many years studying English language but cannot speak it appropriately and understandably.
There are several language learning apps that are quite famous and commonly used today like Duolingo, Andy and WordUp. Although they contain many features and are built in a fun and interactive way, they do not contain voice enabled chatboats for users to improve their speaking skills. They have been developed only to improve vocabulary than focusing on improving fluency in speaking which is utmost important for the present world.
CONVO is a project which is developed by team Hexbots that provide a learning platform for users to learn English and to improve their fluency in speaking English by a single platform. This program helps the user to communicate with the device about day-to-day scenarios in English language based on the scenario selected by the user.
